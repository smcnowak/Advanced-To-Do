# Advanced-To-Do

## Introduction
This is an advanced to do list made using `HTML, CSS, JavaScript`. The project has been developed to better my understanding of **DOM manipulation** 
in JavaScript.

## Description
The project started as a simple to do app, then I added functionalities like **edit, delete, complete and multiple lists** In this 
mainly **DOM manipluation** concepts have been used as well as `LocalStorage`. Along with `JS`,  I have used `HTML & CSS` to 
make the webpage attractive and user freindly.
